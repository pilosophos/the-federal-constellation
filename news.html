          <h2>New startup, Iceberg Systems, wants to turn Spirited Frost into a planet-wide server farm</h2>

          <p><strong>Spirited Frost, Prosperity System</strong> - Just beyond Prosperity's orbit in its star system is Spirited Frost, a cold, uninhabited planet without notable natural resources that Iceberg Systems wants to turn into a planet-wide server farm. The startup has already constructed its pilot server farm on the planet and has bought the deeds for significant portions of the planet's surface. Iceberg Systems was founded by insectoid Blessed Wanderer, a former electrical engineer at Red Sky Heavy Industries who quit her job after using her life savings to start her business and has since gotten sizeable investments from venture capitalists.</p>

          <p>Blessed Wanderer says that unlike most planets in the Constellation, Spirited Frost is unique among uninhabitable worlds in that it has a magnetic field that protects it from cosmic rays. Cosmic rays are a known problem for computers, as excessive cosmic radiation can cause a kind of data corruption called a bit flip, where parts of the binary data unexpectedly flip from 1s to 0s and vice versa. Computers in spacecraft and planetoids without magnetic fields have to be protected by expensive radiation shields which are costly to scale up to planetary-proportions, which Blessed Wanderer explains is why there are no server farm planets in the Constellation so far.</p>

          <p>Spirited Frost also has the perfect temperatures for running computers, she explains. True to its name the planet is frigid, but it's not so cold that mass-produced computer hardware will fail. Temperatures across Spirited Frost are similar to conditions on regions in the far side of <dfn title="The tidally locked homeworld of the fungoids where one side always faces away from a sun">Giver's Ring</dfn> where the permanent cold provides excellent cooling for servers without needing air conditioning.</p>

          <p>Since Spirited Frost's lack of natural resources and uninhabitability make buying up land extremely cheap, Iceberg Systems is expanding rapidly after the success of its pilot server farm. However, the lack of previous interest in the planet also means a lack of infrastructure, so its expansion is limited largely by its ability to build power plants and uplinks to the Constellation's superluminal internetwork.</p>

          <p>"Sure we have limiting factors," says Blessed Wanderer, "but looking at what we've accomplished so far, we are confident that we can build a planet that serves the computational needs of not only Prosperity and the homeworlds, but also the new industrial settlements that are cropping up every <dfn title="Approximately 19 days">kilochron</dfn> across the Prosperity System. We are unburdened by the local regulations on Prosperity, and our scalability means we will soon become the most cost-effective cloud computing solution in the Constellation."</p>

          <h2>Could our next computers be made of bacteria?</h2>
          <small>OOC: Published 2022-08-24 | Development 0.3 (+0.1)</small>

          <p><strong>Celestial Lowlands, Grand Throne</strong> - A breakthrough Pseudo-neuronal bacteria (PNB) was engineered at Celestial Lowlands Biotechnical University which would allow bacterial colonies to perform simple computations and connect reliably with a typical neural-computer interface. These bacteria have axons and dendrites much like a neuron in a brain, and grow in a sugary, polysaccharide mixture. Electrical impulses are initially random, but binding with an artificial protein called the Dumbbell Protein, will allow scientists to adjust when the PNB send electrical impulses to each other and at what strength. The Dumbbell Proteins are produced by the university's Ribosome Machine, an on-demand protein fabricator.</p>

          <p>While the precision of Dumbbell Proteins is currently low, the researchers have been able to create and "train" the colony of PNB and create a deep neural network, not unlike traditional neural algorithms in a digital computer. Researchers first replicated the Exclusive Or operator, which activates if exactly one signal of two input signals is activated, and moved on to more complex functions like integer addition. They found that by connecting colonies of bacteria to a neural implant, they could get one colony to "communicate" with the other.</p>

          <p>Another problem that limits the computational power of PNB is that as soon as the colony becomes too large, it is unable to hold a stable structure and collapses. The only working PNB "brains" currently consist of a maximum of a few dozens cells, although multiple neural interfaces can connect at least a few colonies together without degradation.</p>

          <p>While a long way from the power of devices we take for granted today, this breakthrough opens up a plethora of possibilities. These bacterial colonies could be used to augment someone's brain or eyes without the need for invasive surgical procedures needed for a traditional neural or optical implant. In the distant future, we may even be able to reduce the complexity of computer components by growing a large vat of PNB and reprogramming bacterial colonies for whatever we need. Who knows? maybe one day, we'll write our e-mails and watch holograms on bacteria!</p>

          <h2>Prosperity Orbital Shipyards promises new jobs, better infrastructure</h2>

          <p><strong>Prosperity, Prosperity System</strong> - New job opportunities and bright futures are abound for the Constellation's new colony, Prosperity. Since the beginning of Prosperity's settlement, growth has been limited by the lack of mining outposts on potentially resource-rich planetoids in the system. With the recent completion of the Prosperity Orbital Shipyards, several companies have obtained contracts to build survey, mining, and transportation ships to deploy within the next <dfn title="Approximately 1 year">3 myriochrons</dfn>. Companies are already hiring thousands of workers in the shipbuilding and mining industries, with additional colonists arriving from Grand Throne and Giver's Ring within the next myriochrons.</p>
          
          <p>The Constellation Colonial Administration (CCA) expects it will be able to build infrastructure six times faster in the next 15 myriochrons once mining outposts on all mineral deposits identified during Propserity's initial colonisation feasibility study have been developed. The increased shipbuilding capability of Prosperity also means more ships available to make close-range geological surveys, which the CCA are confident will prompt further discoveries and attract more colonists.</p>

          <p>The completion of the shipyards also means the Prosperity Shuttle Service will service the new mining outposts and make more frequent trips between Giver's Ring. Unfortunately for many riders, the length of the trip to and from Giver's Ring leaves much to be desired. Researchers at the <dfn title="The natural wormhole in the two home systems of the Constellation">Everlasting Communion</dfn> Research Centre have been looking for ways to generate artificial wormholes, albeit at a smaller scale than Everlasting Communion. The Superluminal Steering Commission will also be hosting the 14th 4c Barrier Conference, where scientists will exhibit their latest research in trying to breach speeds greater than 4 times the speed of light, in about <dfn title="Approximately 1 month">3 kilochrons</dfn>.</p>
