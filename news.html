          <h2>Prosperity Orbital Shipyards Promises New Jobs, Better Infrastructure</h2>

          <p><strong>Prosperity, Prosperity System</strong> - New job opportunities and bright futures are abound for the Constellation's new colony, Prosperity. Since the beginning of Prosperity's settlement, growth has been limited by the lack of mining outposts on potentially resource-rich planetoids in the system. With the recent completion of the Prosperity Orbital Shipyards, several companies have obtained contracts to build survey, mining, and transportation ships to deploy within the next <dfn title="Approximately 1 year">3 myriochrons</dfn>. Companies are already hiring thousands of workers in the shipbuilding and mining industries, with additional colonists arriving from Grand Throne and Giver's Ring within the next myriochrons.</p>
          
          <p>The Constellation Colonial Administration (CCA) expects it will be able to build infrastructure six times faster in the next 15 myriochrons once mining outposts on all mineral deposits identified during Propserity's initial colonisation feasibility study have been developed. The increased shipbuilding capability of Prosperity also means more ships available to make close-range geological surveys, which the CCA are confident will prompt further discoveries and attract more colonists.</p>

          <p>The completion of the shipyards also means the Prosperity Shuttle Service will service the new mining outposts and make more frequent trips between Giver's Ring. Unfortunately for many riders, the length of the trip to and from Giver's Ring leaves much to be desired. Researchers at the <dfn title="The natural wormhole in the two home systems of the Constellation">Everlasting Communion</dfn> Research Centre have been looking for ways to generate artificial wormholes, albeit at a smaller scale than Everlasting Communion. The Superluminal Steering Commission will also be hosting the 14th 4c Barrier Conference, where scientists will exhibit their latest research in trying to breach speeds greater than 4 times the speed of light, in about <dfn title="Approximately 1 month">3 kilochrons</dfn>.</p>
