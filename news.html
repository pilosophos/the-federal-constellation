          <p><strong>Spirited Frost, Prosperity System</strong> -  When Blessed Wanderer, founder of Iceberg Systems, started the <a href="#3">planetary data farm</a> at Spirited Frost, it began as a simple idea— to make the best of a cold, uninhabitable world by putting a bunch of computers on it. What she couldn't have known was that it would spark a computing revolution, bolstering the computing power of the Prosperity System to that rivalling Giver's Ring.</p>
          <p>The runaway success has drawn <dfn title="A gross equals 144">grosses</dfn> of companies and billions of Stella in investments to the Prosperity system. One such company is quantum computing giant, Subatomic, which partnered with Iceberg Systems to build quantum data farms on the frosty planet. To test its capabilities, Subatomic has been donating compute power to the Brain in a Pocket project. The project lets volunteers donate their computers' unused resources to simulate the brain of the <em>spritely button</em>, a species of <dfn title="In contrast to Higher Fungoids, there are many species lesser fungoids which are non-sapient fungus creatures">lesser fungoid</dfn> smaller than an Insectoid hair's width.</p>

          <p>Brain in a Pocket is a collaboration between labs studying how different types of brains work, starting with simulating simple microscopic worms and now complex species like the spritely button. Originally it just used idle computers from each lab, but as the simulations grew more complex, more computing power was needed. Taking cues from Eyes on the Sky, another volunteer computing project for discovering signs of alien intelligence, Brain in a Pocket started crowdsourcing compute power, making complex simulations possible.</p>

          <p>Now that genes from <a href="#4">new species of life</a> are being used to solve problems like ocean pollution, scientists hope that understanding life at tiny quantum scales now can make a big impact in the future, since many potential applications are locked behind nano-scale mysteries. As the name implies, quantum computers like Subatomic's are uniquely well suited for quantum simulations, plus other tasks like handling databases. In fact, most people already use quantum computers without even knowing it, since they currently power social networking sites and search engines.</p>

          <p>Though impressive, <dfn title="A great gross equals 12^3">greatgross</dfn>-fold speed increase to Brain in a Pocket is just a test, claims Subatomic, a demonstration of only a fraction of what Subatomic plans to build on Spirited Frost. Subatomic believes it can lower the cost of quantum computing enough that even small businesses can afford to process their data with quantum computers within the next <dfn title="Approximately 7.6 years">dozen myriochrons</dfn>. For now, it is putting its power to good use and making a tremendous contribution to science, which you can see at the <a href="#Error: Your browser does not support the nodelink's character encoding!">Brain in a Pocket internetwork node</a>.</p>

          <p><strong>Communion Wormhole Observatory, Grand Throne System</strong> - For most people, making the trip from Giver's Ring to the Prosperity colony is a major life decision. Crowds of colonists buy tickets on the Prosperity Shuttle Service, which includes deep-space lodging and meal plans, up to <dfn title="1 myriochron is approximately 7.8 months">myriochrons</dfn> in advance for a new way of life on the distant colony. Without a wormhole like Everlasting Communion to get you there, <dfn title="Approximately 1 year">1.6 myriochrons</dfn> is the fastest possible trip— long enough to produce an entire TV drama and then some. Luckily, engineers have been working with experts at the Communion Wormhole Observatory to develop the next generation of superluminal drives, called Plasma Soliton Drives, which could slash the Prosperity trip time from myriochrons to <dfn title="1 kilochron is approximately 20 days">kilochrons</dfn>, which is an entire magnitude of improvement over currently available <dfn title="An Alcubierre drive with a simple 'warp bubble' geometry">Warp Bubble Drives</dfn>.</p>

          <p>Instead of simply contracting space in front and expanding space behind it like a Warp Bubble Drive using expensive strange matter, the Plasma Soliton Drive uses a supercharged electromagnetic plasma in a delta-formation in order to generate soliton waves in spacetime. These soliton waves are like tsunamis in oceans, propagating itself over long distances and carrying a calm, inner region of space through great distances. Unlike the Warp Bubble Drive, these solitons can be maintained using only ordinary, positive-energy matter, and only need strange matter for starting and stopping.</p>

          <p>While such soliton drives have been theorized to work since before even the first Warp Bubble Drives were built, it is not until now that improvements to spacetime soliton theory made by physicists during the last few <a href="#1">4c Barrier Conferences</a> allowed the creation of the first practical Plasma Soliton Drive. These refinements not only lowers costs needed to power the massive particle accelerators for creating strange matter, but are also much faster and could lead to more frequent trips to and from Prosperity.</p>

          <p>Currently the main challenges for mass-transit with Plasma Soliton Drives include the Superluminal Communication Problem, where the complex geometry of soliton spacetime interfere with superluminal communications links with deep space beacons and refuelling stations. The size of the safe region between the solitons also needs to get much bigger for the economics of the shuttle service to make sense. However, the researchers and engineers at the Communion Wormhole Observatory are confident they can solve both these problems in the near future.</p>

          <h2>Exotic lithium-binding life in Prosperity System could clean up pollution in oceans, researchers find</h2>

          </figure>

          <p><strong>Reflection Point, Prosperity</strong> - Researchers at Reflection Point University have announced they have successfully implanted genes from several recently discovered species of exotic microbes into algae from Giver's Ring that can clean up heavy metals from oceans and rivers. About a <dfn title="Approximately 6 months">myriochron</dfn> ago, the Curious Ranger survey ship was constructed at <a href="#1">Prosperity Orbital Shipyards</a> and started collecting water samples from several moons around the Prosperity System suspected to harbour exotic microbial life. These samples were brought back and analysed by Researcher Equitable Arbiter and his team, who confimed the presence of extremophile microbes in several samples.</p>

          <p>In one of the samples they discovered that a microbe, named Silver Breath 8-216, produces proteins which bind with lithium, then aggregate in large clumps after binding. Recognizing its potential to clean up lithium pollution in water, Researcher Equitable Arbiter and his team first created a concentrated protein solution and put it in industrial waste water. They found that the resulting protein clumps could be taken out, and with the lithium attached, a large amount of lithium was also removed.</p>
          
          <p>Lithium can pollute water through improper storage and dumping of old electronics, especially old lithium-ion batteries. Lithium mining and drug manufacturing can also have lithium byproducts, which leech into the ground and can make its way into water sources. Excessive lithium consumption leads to several neurological issues, including cortical dysfunction, muscle spasms, and Driven Remembrancer's Syndrome. Equitable Arbiter's discovery could improve the lives of millions living in polluted areas.</p>

          <p>Equitable Arbiter and his team don't know what the purpose of this protein is for the microbe, but have identified the part of its genome that produces it and have implanted it into the Swimmer's Spots algae, native to Grand Throne. While Silver Breath 8-216 can't survive in most climates habitable to known sentient species, Swimmer's Spots can survive, and using the newly dicovered genes produces the anti-pollutant at the same time.</p>

          <p>Though it is undergoing continued testing to determine its overall ecological impact if released into different polluted oceans in the Constellation, the Researcher and his team are excited at the prospect of a low-maintenance, genetically-engineered solution to lithium pollution.</p>

          <h2>New startup, Iceberg Systems, wants to turn Spirited Frost into a planet-wide server farm</h2>
          <small>OOC: Published 2022-08-27 | Development 0.4 (+0.1)</small>

        <main class="card-body">
          <p><strong>Spirited Frost, Prosperity System</strong> - Just beyond Prosperity's orbit in its star system is Spirited Frost, a cold, uninhabited planet without notable natural resources that Iceberg Systems wants to turn into a planet-wide server farm. The startup has already constructed its pilot server farm on the planet and has bought the deeds for significant portions of the planet's surface. Iceberg Systems was founded by Insectoid Blessed Wanderer, a former electrical engineer at Red Sky Heavy Industries who quit her job after using her life savings to start her business and has since gotten sizeable investments from venture capitalists.</p>

          <p>Blessed Wanderer says that unlike most planets in the Constellation, Spirited Frost is unique among uninhabitable worlds in that it has a magnetic field that protects it from cosmic rays. Cosmic rays are a known problem for computers, as excessive cosmic radiation can cause a kind of data corruption called a bit flip, where parts of the binary data unexpectedly flip from 1s to 0s and vice versa. Computers in spacecraft and planetoids without magnetic fields have to be protected by expensive radiation shields which are costly to scale up to planetary-proportions, which Blessed Wanderer explains is why there are no server farm planets in the Constellation so far.</p>

          <p>Spirited Frost also has the perfect temperatures for running computers, she explains. True to its name the planet is frigid, but it's not so cold that mass-produced computer hardware will fail. Temperatures across Spirited Frost are similar to conditions on regions in the far side of <dfn title="The tidally locked homeworld of the Fungoids where one side always faces away from a sun">Giver's Ring</dfn> where the permanent cold provides excellent cooling for servers without needing air conditioning.</p>

          <p>Since Spirited Frost's lack of natural resources and uninhabitability make buying up land extremely cheap, Iceberg Systems is expanding rapidly after the success of its pilot server farm. However, the lack of previous interest in the planet also means a lack of infrastructure, so its expansion is limited largely by its ability to build power plants and uplinks to the Constellation's superluminal internetwork.</p>

          <p>"Sure we have limiting factors," says Blessed Wanderer, "but looking at what we've accomplished so far, we are confident that we can build a planet that serves the computational needs of not only Prosperity and the homeworlds, but also the new industrial settlements that are cropping up every <dfn title="Approximately 19 days">kilochron</dfn> across the Prosperity System. We are unburdened by the local regulations on Prosperity, and our scalability means we will soon become the most cost-effective cloud computing solution in the Constellation."</p>

          <h2>Could our next computers be made of bacteria?</h2>
          <small>OOC: Published 2022-08-24 | Development 0.3 (+0.1)</small>

          <p><strong>Celestial Lowlands, Grand Throne</strong> - A breakthrough Pseudo-neuronal bacteria (PNB) was engineered at Celestial Lowlands Biotechnical University which would allow bacterial colonies to perform simple computations and connect reliably with a typical neural-computer interface. These bacteria have axons and dendrites much like a neuron in a brain, and grow in a sugary, polysaccharide mixture. Electrical impulses are initially random, but binding with an artificial protein called the Dumbbell Protein, will allow scientists to adjust when the PNB send electrical impulses to each other and at what strength. The Dumbbell Proteins are produced by the university's Ribosome Machine, an on-demand protein fabricator.</p>

          <p>While the precision of Dumbbell Proteins is currently low, the researchers have been able to create and "train" the colony of PNB and create a deep neural network, not unlike traditional neural algorithms in a digital computer. Researchers first replicated the Exclusive Or operator, which activates if exactly one signal of two input signals is activated, and moved on to more complex functions like integer addition. They found that by connecting colonies of bacteria to a neural implant, they could get one colony to "communicate" with the other.</p>

          <p>Another problem that limits the computational power of PNB is that as soon as the colony becomes too large, it is unable to hold a stable structure and collapses. The only working PNB "brains" currently consist of a maximum of a few dozens cells, although multiple neural interfaces can connect at least a few colonies together without degradation.</p>

          <p>While a long way from the power of devices we take for granted today, this breakthrough opens up a plethora of possibilities. These bacterial colonies could be used to augment someone's brain or eyes without the need for invasive surgical procedures needed for a traditional neural or optical implant. In the distant future, we may even be able to reduce the complexity of computer components by growing a large vat of PNB and reprogramming bacterial colonies for whatever we need. Who knows? maybe one day, we'll write our e-mails and watch holograms on bacteria!</p>

          <h2>Prosperity Orbital Shipyards promises new jobs, better infrastructure</h2>

        <main class="card-body">
          <p><strong>Prosperity, Prosperity System</strong> - New job opportunities and bright futures are abound for the Constellation's new colony, Prosperity. Since the beginning of Prosperity's settlement, growth has been limited by the lack of mining outposts on potentially resource-rich planetoids in the system. With the recent completion of the Prosperity Orbital Shipyards, several companies have obtained contracts to build survey, mining, and transportation ships to deploy within the next <dfn title="Approximately 1 year">3 myriochrons</dfn>. Companies are already hiring thousands of workers in the shipbuilding and mining industries, with additional colonists arriving from Grand Throne and Giver's Ring within the next myriochrons.</p>
          
          <p>The Constellation Colonial Administration (CCA) expects it will be able to build infrastructure six times faster in the next 15 myriochrons once mining outposts on all mineral deposits identified during Propserity's initial colonization feasibility study have been developed. The increased shipbuilding capability of Prosperity also means more ships available to make close-range geological surveys, which the CCA are confident will prompt further discoveries and attract more colonists.</p>

          <p>The completion of the shipyards also means the Prosperity Shuttle Service will service the new mining outposts and make more frequent trips between Giver's Ring. Unfortunately for many riders, the length of the trip to and from Giver's Ring leaves much to be desired. Researchers at the <dfn title="The natural wormhole in the two home systems of the Constellation">Everlasting Communion</dfn> Research Centre have been looking for ways to generate artificial wormholes, albeit at a smaller scale than Everlasting Communion. The Superluminal Steering Commission will also be hosting the 14th 4c Barrier Conference, where scientists will exhibit their latest research in trying to breach speeds greater than 4 times the speed of light, in about <dfn title="Approximately 1 month">3 kilochrons</dfn>.</p>
