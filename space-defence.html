        <main class="card-body">
          <p>Spacecraft are colloquially divided into "ships" and "stations," although the line between them is not always clear. Stations may have small thrusters to correct its orbit, but are are not permanently equipped with superluminal drives. Subluminal ships are not equipped with superluminal drives, but are designed to move frequently. Superluminal ships are permanently equipped with superluminal drives.</p>

          <dl>
            <dt>Heavy weapons craft (HWC)</dt>
            <dd><p>Heavy weapons craft are extremely large spacecraft outfitted with a variety of weapon types. HWCs that permanently defend a stationary target are known as weapon platforms. HWC ships are typically employed in symmetric encounters with large engagements.</p></dd>

            <dt>Light weapons craft (LWC)</dt>
            <dd><p>Light weapons craft are small, maneuverable combat craft used for asymmetric search-and-destroy tasks. They are commonly seen in anti-piracy and anti-guerilla engagements.</p></dd>

            <dt>Shuttle</dt>
            <dd><p>Shuttles are small, subluminal ships which transport small groups or individuals to and from planetary atmospheres. Superluminal shuttles are rarely seen, as warp drives are expensive and maintaining warp geometry is energy intensive.</p></dd>

            <dt>Command and control craft</dt>
            <dd><p>Command and control craft coordinate fleet movements and calculate weapon volleys. They are outfitted with a variety of sensors, as well as a compute cluster to analyze data from onboard instruments and from ships in its command. They host communications arrays and often comm-repeater probes to extend the range of their communications.</p></dd>

            <dt>Fleet tender ship</dt>
            <dd><p>Fleet tender ships allow other ships to dock with it to perform repairs and refuel in the field. They are equippable with modular cargo bays to store fuel and parts. They are important in deep-space combat where the nearest spacedock is far away. Tenders are distinguished from spacedocks by their ease of mobility, and do not build new ships.</p></dd>

            <dt>Hospital ship</dt>
            <dd><p>Hospital ships are mobile field hospitals. They are important in humanitarian missions, or if many ships are expected to operate away from a hospital for extended periods of time.</p></dd>

            <dt>Engine ship</dt>
            <dd><p>Formations of multiple engine ships are often used to create a large warp bubble around subluminal ships to transport them at superluminal speeds en masse. Each engine ship projects one part of the warp geometry at the same time as all the other engine ships, so transporting large areas requires more engine ships. A few engine ships are usually held in reserve in case a primary engine ship fails.</p></dd>

            <dt>Interdictor</dt>
            <dd>
              <p>Interdictors are any spacecraft that prevent other ships from traveling at superluminal speeds. They are mainly used for protecting solar systems from warping spacetime, which would upset the motion of objects due to gravitational forces. They are also used in chase scenarios, to slow down and apprehend targets. Multi-interdictor formations are common to extend the range of interdiction.</p>
              <p>Most interdictors are also engine ships because their method of interdiction involves an upgraded superluminal drive (namely the <a href="#pie">phase-inverse engine</a>).</p>

            <h4>Mechanism</h4>
            <p>An array of high-energy, circularly polarized lasers comprising a single LAFS unit (colloquially known as a "cannon") is directed at a target and fired in an instantaneous burst. In a vacuum, the beam is invisible except at the target, since the photons all travel in one direction and scatter on contact with the target. This generates a strong magnetic field at the target through an Inverse Faraday effect driven by radiation friction.</p>

            <h4>Usage</h4>
            <p>Used to scatter electromagnetic energy in all directions, such as charged plasmas from weapons systems and warp drives. The scattering is useful in defending against weapons using electromagnetic fields to concentrate energy on a target. Scattering is also useful as a superluminal travel interdiction mechanism. Since Constellation warp drives operate by concentrating energy density in charged plasmas that are shaped through magnetic fields, the magnetic fields generated by the LAFS interferes with the magnetic energy "shell" which holds the charged plasma together, preventing the energy densities required to warp spacetime.</p>

            <h4>Limitations</h4>
            <p>Each laser burst requires a significant amount of electrical energy to fire. Normally, high-voltage capacitors are used to build up this energy, and rate-of-fire depends on the recharge rate of these capacitors. Most military spacecraft with appreciable armor plating are not greatly affected by a single burst, making the LAFS a primarily defensive weapon against energy projectiles.</p>

            <h4>Mechanism</h4>
            <p>PIEs are interdiction devices consisting of a low-latency gravity sensor and superluminal drive combination. The gravity sensor detects any change in the warping of spacetime and warps space in the opposite direction and magnitude, similar to the inverted-phase sound waves from noise cancelling headphones. This cancels spacetime warping required to travel at superluminal speeds. An onboard computer calculates the spacetime warping the PIE must produce in order to produce the cancelling effect.</p>

            <h4>Usage</h4>
            <p>Many PIEs are usually placed in formation for full coverage over an area. Though PIEs are primarily used for interdiction, since they are simply a gravity sensor connected to a superluminal drive, a PIE is often usable as a regular superluminal drive as well.</p>

            <h4>Limitations</h4>
            <p>Warping spacetime is an energy-intensive operation, and requires negative energy to cancel the amount of spacetime warping required for superluminal travel. A superluminal drive also has a limited range where it can quickly manipulate warp geometry, so at long range it must propagate gravitational waves from the origin which is computationally expensive. The complexity of the warped geometry also affects computation time, and a trade off must be made between accuracy and response time.</p>
